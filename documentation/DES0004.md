# DES0004 Signature is dictated by its usage as a ComponentPredicate

Signature is dictated by its usage as a ComponentPredicate.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

RCS1242 - Do not pass non-read-only struct by read-only reference

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using DefaultEcs.System;

namespace DummyNamespace
{
    class DummyClass
    {
        [WithPredicate]
        bool DummyMethod(in object _) => true;
    }
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

The IDE does not detect that the method signature is dictated by its usage as a ComponentPredicate through the WithPredicateAttribute and under normal circumstances, it would be reasonable to change its signature.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

The IDE does not detect that the method signature is dictated by its usage as a ComponentPredicate through the WithPredicateAttribute.
