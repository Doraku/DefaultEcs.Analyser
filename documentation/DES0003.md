# DES0003 Signature is dictated by IPublisher

Signature is dictated by IPublisher.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

RCS1242 - Do not pass non-read-only struct by read-only reference

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using DefaultEcs.System;

namespace DummyNamespace
{
    class DummyClass
    {
        [Subscribe]
        void DummyMethod(in object _)
        { }
    }
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

The IDE does not detect that the method signature is dictated by its usage by IPulblisher through the SubscribeAttribute and under normal circumstances, it would be reasonable to change its signature.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?
