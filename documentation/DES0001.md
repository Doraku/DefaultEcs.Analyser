# DES0001 Private member is used by reflection

Private member is used by reflection

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE0051 - Remove unused member

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using DefaultEcs;

namespace DummyNamespace
{
    class DummyClass
    {
        [Subscribe]
        void DummyMethod(in bool _)
        { }
    }
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

The IDE does not detect that the method will be used by reflection and under normal circumstances, it would be reasonable to remove the unused method.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

The IDE doesn't realize this method will be subscribed to by reflection.
